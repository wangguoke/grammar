PostgreSQL Grammar Parser.

First, I want to use this tool to check the SQL from the application whether it works.  
In the next, I want to use this tool as a proxy tool to transform the SQL  
to plan query trees to the database.  
So we can transfer the read-only SQL to the Backup Server.  
Or we can transform the SQL to sub-query to the distributed database server.  
All the grammar is based on PostgreSQL.
